mrcore should noly include js files that are critical to built in functionality, like if the filenamanter uses
blueimp images, then include it.  All others should be removed.

for all workbenches, you should never use any mrcore js files, because you can never assume I won't delete or change
their versions, so use your own setup for workbenches and don't rely on anything being present in mrcore
